## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in RealHome, please report it to our security team at mr.purushothamreddy23@gmail.com . 
We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in disclosing the issue responsibly.

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much detail as possible, including:

    Description of the vulnerability
    Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
    Affected versions of RealHome
    Any additional relevant information
    
Our security team will acknowledge receipt of your report within 2 business days and will work to validate the issue promptly. We aim to provide regular updates on the status of reported vulnerabilities and will notify you of any progress or resolution.

Once a vulnerability is validated, our team will assess its severity and impact on RealHome users. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work diligently to develop and release a patch or mitigation strategy in a timely manner.

If a vulnerability report is declined, we will provide a clear explanation of the reasons for our decision. We encourage reporters to engage in open dialogue with our security team to address any questions or concerns.

Thank you for helping to keep RealHome safe and secure for all users.
